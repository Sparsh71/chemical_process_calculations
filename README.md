Grading:
The grading scheme used at IITGN is explained in the "Advisories" document on the internal website of IITGN. The letter grades and their equivalent on the 10-point scale are provided there. The final grades of this course will have the following weightage:

1. Assignments: 30%

2. Mid-sem: 35%

3. End-sem: 35%

The solutions will be graded based on the following aspects:

1. Conceptual understanding: 40% weight

2. Correct figures: 40% weight

3. Presentation: 20% weight

The main objectives of the course are as follows:

1. To introduce the types of processes that are encountered in the chemical industry.

2. To explain the ways of obtaining the necessary thermodynamic properties from the available data.

3. To familiarize with the strategies for systematically determining the unknown information about the "input" and/or the "output" of a process.

4. To introduce the recent advances in the field of chemical process calculations.

Recommended textbooks: 

1) "Elementary Principles of Chemical Processes" by Richard M. Felder and Ronald W. Rousseau

2) "Basic Priciples and Calculations in Chemical Engineering" by David M. Himmelblau and James B. Riggs

3) "Stoichiometry" by B. I. Bhatt and S. B. Thakore

Content of lectures and tutorials:

1 lecture per week: Discussion about the fundamental concepts. The information will be updated on this site in advance.

2 tutorials per week: Solving selected problems from the textbook and explaining the strategies. Notes about the strategies will be updated in advance. The problem statements will be provided to the students during the tutorial session.

1 assignment per week: Selected problems that may or may not be from the textbook. These will be communicated to the students during the lectures and/or tutorials.

NOTE: The problem statements and solutions are not posted on this webpage to comply with the copyrights (if any) of the authors of the textbooks. Please email at kaustubh [[dot]] rane21 [[at]] gmail [[dot]] com with any queries regarding the content.

IMPORTANT: How to use this repository

1. In 2016, we attempted the use of .mm files (see chem_process_calc_2016.mm). This file could be accessed using a software called Docear. In 2017, we will use LaTeX files for each lecture. A file will be uploaded after the lecture. Each file has blank section at the end with each student's name. This is the space where the student can add her/his additions/corrections/doubts/summary of the lecture. This arrangement is to avoid conflicts. Students outside IITGN can add their modifications by creating an aditional section at the end with their names.   

2. In order to request addition to the files, please create a GitHub account, fork the repository, make changes to a file and submit the pull request to me. The procedure is explained in detail on https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

3. In order to avoid conflicts, the additions should be made as follows: 

3. If you are a student taking the course at IIT Gandhinagar, I will recommend creating the GitHub account such that your identity is easily determined.
